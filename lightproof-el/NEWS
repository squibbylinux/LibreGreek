        foo -> bar # bar is far better

        instead of the old
        
        (?i)\bfoo\b -> bar # bar is far better

        - character rules: old default
            - [Char]: ignore case
            - [case]: case sensitive

    - expressions in suggestions: specified by a starting equal sign
    
        foo\w+ -> =\0.upper() # suggest with uppercase letters

      spell: spelling (Boolean function)
