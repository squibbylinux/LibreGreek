pattern -> replacement # message

or (see Conditions)

pattern <- condition -> replacement # message

or

pattern <- condition -> = replacement # = expression_for_message
pattern <- condition -> = expression_to_generate_replacement_string # message
pattern <- condition -> = expression_to_generate_replacement_string # = expression_for_message


Basically pattern and replacement will be the parameters of the
standard Python re.sub() regular expression function (see also
Python regex module documentation for regular expression syntax:
http://docs.python.org/library/re.html).

Example 0. Report "foo" in the text and suggest "bar":

foo -> bar # Use bar instead of foo.

Example 1. Recognize and suggest missing hyphen:

foo bar -> foo-bar # Missing hyphen.

= Rule Sections =

Example 2. Recognize double or more spaces and suggests a single space:

[char]

"  +" -> " " # Extra space.

The line [char] changes the default word-level rules to character-level ones.
Use [Word] to change back to the (case-insensitive) word-level rules.
Also [word] is for the case-sensitive word-level rules, and [Char] for the
case-insensitive character-level rules.

ASCII " characters protect spaces in the pattern and in the replacement text.
Plus sign means 1 or more repetitions of the previous space.

= Other examples =

Example 3. Suggest a word with correct quotation marks:

\"(\w+)\" -> “\1” # Correct quotation marks.

(Here \" is an ASCII quotation mark, \w means an arbitrary letter,
+ means 1 or more repetitions of the previous object,
The parentheses define a regex group (the word). In the
replacement, \1 is a reference to the (first) group of the pattern.)

Example 4. Suggest the missing space after the !, ? or . signs:

\b([?!.])([a-zA-Z]+) -> \1 \2 # Missing space?

\b is the zero-length word boundary regex notation, so
\b signs the end and the begin of the words.

The [ and ] define a character pattern, the replacement will contain
the actual matching character (?, ! or .), a space and the word after
the punctuation character.
Note: ? and . characters have special meanings in regular expressions,
use [?] or [.] patterns to check "?" and "." signs in the text.

== Multiple suggestions ==

Use \n (new line) in the replacement text to add multiple suggestions:

foo -> Foo\nFOO\nBar\nBAR # Did you mean:

(Foo, FOO, Bar and BAR suggestions for the input word "foo")

= Expressions in the suggestions =

Suggestions (and warning messages) started by an equal sign are Python string expressions
extended with possible back references and named definitions:

Example:

foo\w+ -> = '"' + \0.upper() + '"' # With uppercase letters and quoation marks

All words beginning with "foo" will be recognized, and the suggestion is
the uppercase form of the string with ASCII quoation marks: eg. foom -> "FOOM".

== No suggestion ==

You can display message without making suggestions. For this purpose, use a single character _ in the replacement field.

Example:

foobar -> _ # Message

== Longer explanations ==

Warning messages can contain optional URLs for longer explanations separated by "\n":

(your|her|our|their)['’]s -> \1s # Possessive pronoun: \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive_pronoun

== Back references in explanations ==

(fooo) bar -> foo bar # “\1” should be:

== Default variables ==

LOCALE

It contains the current locale of the checked paragraph. Its fields:
For en-US LOCALE.Language = "en" and LOCALE.Country = "US", eg.

colour <- LOCALE.Language == "US" -> color # Use American English spelling.

TEXT

Full text of the checked paragraph.

== Name definitions ==

Lightproof supports name definitions to simplify the
description of the complex rules.

Definition:

name pattern # name definition

Usage in the rules:

"{name} " -> "{name}. " # Missing dot?

{Name}s in the first part of the rules mean
subpatterns (groups). {Name}s in the second
part of the rules mean back references to the
matched texts of the subpatterns.

Example: thousand markers (10000 -> 10,000 or 10 000)

# definitions
d \d\d\d	# name definition: 3 digits
d2 \d\d		# 2 digits
D \d{1,3}	# 1, 2 or 3 digits

# rules
# ISO thousand marker: space, here: no-break space (U+00A0)
{d2}{d} -> {d2},{d}\n{d2} {d}           # Use thousand marker (common or ISO).
{D}{d}{d} -> {D},{d},{d}\n{D} {d} {d}   # Use thousand markers (common or ISO).

Note: Lightproof uses named groups for name definitions and
their references, adding a hidden number to the group names
in the form of "_n". You can use these explicit names in the replacement:

{d2}{d} -> {d2_1},{d_1}\n{d2_1} {d_1}	# Use thousand marker (common or ISO).
{D}{d}{d} -> {D_1},{d_1},{d_2}\n{D_1} {d_1} {d_2} # Use thousand markers (common or ISO).

Note: back references of name definitions are zeroed after new line
characters, see this and the following example:

E ( |$)                       # name definition: space or end of sentence
"\b[.][.]{E}" -> .{E}\n…{E}   # Period or ellipsis?

See src/en/en.dat for more examples.

= Error positioning =

By default, the full pattern will be underlined with blue.
You can shorten the underlined text area by specifying a back reference group of the pattern.
Instead of writing ->, write -n>  n being the number of a back reference group.
Actually,  ->  is similar to  -0>

Example
(ying) and yang -1> yin # Did you mean:

== Comparison ==

Rule 1:
ying and yang -> yin and yang # Did you mean:

Rule 2:
(ying) and yang -1> yin # Did you mean:

With the rule 1, the full pattern is underlined:
    ying and yang
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the rule 2, only the first back reference group is underlined:
    ying and yang
    ^^^^

= Conditions =

A Lightproof condition is a Python condition with some modifications:
the \0..\9 regex notations and the Lightproof {name} notations in the condition will be
replaced by the matched subpatterns. For example, the rule

\w+ <- \0 == "foo" -> Foo # Foo is a capitalized word.

is equivalent of the following rule:

foo -> Foo # Foo is a capitalized word.

== Standard functions ==

There are some default function for the rule conditions.


word(n) or word(-n):

The function word(n) returns the Nth word (separated only by white spaces)
before or after the matching pattern, or None, if this word doesn't exist.


morph(word, regex pattern):
morph(word, regex pattern, all):

The function morph returns a matching subpattern of the morphological analysis
of the input word or None, if the pattern won't match all items of the
analysis of the input word. For example, the rule

\ban ([a-z]\w+) <- morph(\1, "(po:verb|is:plural)") -> and \1 # Missing letter?

will find the word "an" followed by a not capitalized verb or a plural noun (the notation depends from the morphological data of
the Hunspell dictionary).

The optional argument can modify the default "all" mode to "if exists", using
the False value:

morph(word, regex pattern, False):

stem(word):

The function returns an arraw with the stems of the input word.

Usage:

(\w+) <- "foo" in stem(\1) -> bar # One of the stem of the word is "foo"

(\w+) <- stem(\1) == ["foo"] -> bar # The word has got only one stem, "foo".



affix(word, regex pattern):
affix(word, regex pattern, all):

Variant of morph: it filters the affix fields from the result of the analysis
before matching the pattern.

The optional argument can modify the default "all" mode to "if exists", using
the False value:

affix(word, regex pattern, False):


calc(functionname, functionparameters):

Access to the Calc functions. Functionparameters is a tuple with the parameter
of the Calc function:

calc("CONCATENATE", ("string1", "string2"))


generate(word, example_word):

Morphological generation by example, eg. the result of generate("mouse",
"rodents") is ["mice"] with the en_US English dictionary. (See also
Hunspell (4) manual page for morphological generation.)

option(optionname):

Return the Boolean value of the option (see doc/dialog.txt).

== Multi-line rules ==

Rules can be break to multiple lines by leading tabulators:

pattern <- condition
	# only comment
	-> replacement
	# message (last comment)

== User code support ==

Use [code] sections to add your own Python functions for the rules:

Example (suggesting uppercase form for all words with underline character,
for example hello_world -> HELLO_WORLD)

[code]

def u(s):
    return s.upper()

[Word]

# suggest uppercase form for all words with underline character

\w+_\w+ -> =u(\0) # Use uppercase form

(In fact, this is equivalent of the following rule:

\w+_\w+ -> =\0.upper() # Use uppercase form)

See English rules (src/en/en.dat) for more examples, eg. precompiled regular
expressions for sentence checking, sets to handle more irregular words etc.

= Typical problems =

== Encoding ==

Python expressions (< Python 3.0) need explicit Unicode declaration for non-ASCII
characters:

fó -> bár # example

is equivalent of the following rule (see u'string' instead of 'string')

fó -> = u'bár' # example

== Pattern matching ==

Repeating pattern matching of a single rule continues after the previous matching, so
instead of general multiword patterns, like

(\w+) (\w+) <- some_check(\1, \2) -> \1, \2 # foo

use

(\w+) <- some_check(\1, word(1)) -> \1, # foo
